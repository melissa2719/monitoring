#Amazon Rainforest Fires: A comparison between 2015-2019
#I want to analyze NDVI, Temperature and Fire disturbance in Amazonian rainforest during fires in 2015 and 2019; morover I will compare the results to see the impacts on vegetation and biomes
#Since 2019 have had the worst impact on Amazon Rainforest I expect to see in my results <NDVI; >T and >fire disturbance for 2019 rather then 2015

#In order to do that I need to install all the needed packages before starting my analysis

#needed packages
# to read the copernicus data I have to install a package and to use "" in order to let R know that the data is external to the program 
install.packages("ncdf4") 
#to recall the package installed, I need to use the function library 
library(ncdf4)

# I'm going to install also ggplot2 that is used to create graphics 
install.packages("ggplot2")
#and recall the package using library function
library(ggplot2)

#Another package useful for the analysis is RStoolbox that is used for remote sensing image processing 
install.packages("RStoolbox")
library(RStoolbox)

# Since data are saved in pixels need to install raster package too. In the spatial world, each pixel represents an area on the Earth's surface.
install.packages("raster")
library(raster)

# Last step before start is setting the working directory; since I am a windows user i will use setwd("c:/name of the folder which contain the data downloaded/")
setwd("c:/lab/")

# As I said previously, for this project I want to study NDVI, land surface temperature and fire disturbance in 2015 and 2019. See if and how those variables have changed in these years Amazonian Rainforest due to fires 

## NDVI ANALYSIS
# The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is an indicator of the greenness of the biomes therefore it's useful to observe how much of the vegetation is alive.
# I am going to check NDVI for 2015; 2019; 2020. I choose the month August since it has been the month of the highest peak for fires.  
#I expect to see >NDVI for 2015 rather than 2019 and 2020 since the biomes have been threaten by fires and by deforestation too. These episode are increasing so I expect to see less vegetation going on with years.

# I am using "" because the data are external to R and I need to import them.
